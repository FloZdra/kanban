This 5-session TD aims at developing a Kanban Board, mainly with the entities of Developers and Tasks.

Students will have to develop all layers of the application :
- domain layer with JPA Entities
- data layer with repositories
- service layer
- controller layer exposing a REST API
- front-end layer, displaying screens and accessing data via the REST API

During sessions 1 and 2, students will work on domain, data, and service layers.

During session 3, students will work on controller layer.

During sessions 4 and 5, students will work on front-end layer.

## Back-end stack

Back-end is structured around SpringBoot, and bootsrapped by Spring Initializr.

Domain layer will be implemented with JPA Entities.

Data layer will be implemented with JPA Repositories.

Service layer will be implemented with Spring Services.

Controller layer will be implemented with Spring Rest Controllers.

Unit tests will be implemented with JUnit and SpringBoot Test infrastructure.

Maven will be used as build tool for the back-end.

## Front-end stack

Front-end will be bult using VueJs and Vue-CLI bootsrapper.

# Input

Project will be launched without any input at session 1.

At session 3, a Maven project with functional service, data and domain layer will be provided, to provide appropriate layers for implementing controllers.

At session 4, a functional back-end will be provided, to provide appropriate layers for implementing front-end.
